//! Shared font service: the part of text-typeset that can be shared
//! across many widgets viewing many documents.
//!
//! A [`TextFontService`] owns four things:
//!
//! - a font registry (parsed faces, family lookup, fallback chain),
//! - a GPU-bound glyph atlas (RGBA texture with bucketed allocations),
//! - a glyph cache keyed on `(face, glyph_id, physical_size_px)`,
//! - a `swash` scale context (reusable rasterizer workspace).
//!
//! None of these describe **what** a specific widget is showing — they
//! describe **how** glyphs are rasterized and cached. Two widgets
//! viewing the same or different documents in the same window should
//! share one `TextFontService` so that:
//!
//! 1. every glyph for a given `(face, size)` lives in one atlas
//!    and is uploaded to the GPU exactly once per frame;
//! 2. every shaped glyph rasterization happens at most once,
//!    amortized over every widget that ever renders it;
//! 3. font registration and fallback resolution are consistent
//!    across the whole UI.
//!
//! Per-widget state — viewport, zoom, scroll offset, flow layout,
//! cursor, colors — lives on a separate [`DocumentFlow`] that borrows
//! the service at layout and render time.
//!
//! [`DocumentFlow`]: crate::DocumentFlow
//!
//! # HiDPI invalidation
//!
//! [`set_scale_factor`](TextFontService::set_scale_factor) is the one
//! mutation that invalidates existing work: cached glyphs were
//! rasterized at the old physical ppem and are wrong at the new one,
//! and flow layouts stored shaped advances that depended on the
//! previous ppem rounding. The service clears its own glyph cache
//! and atlas on the spot, but it cannot reach into per-widget
//! [`DocumentFlow`] instances. Instead it bumps a monotonic
//! `scale_generation` counter every time the scale factor changes.
//! Each `DocumentFlow` remembers the generation it was last laid out
//! at. Call [`DocumentFlow::layout_dirty_for_scale`] from the
//! framework side to ask "does this flow need a relayout?" and re-run
//! `layout_full` when the answer is yes.
